## [Regression Diagnostic with R](https://github.com/sana1410/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Linear%20Regression)
1.In this project we are going to fit, interpret and evaluate linear regression model on “AmesHousing” dataset.
2.Performed Exploratory Data analysis and descriptive statistics to describe data.
3.Performed Data cleaning by imputing missing values with zero.
4.Created correlation matrix and plots to find highly correlated variables.
5.Performed Linear regression and model interpretation using diagnostic plots.
6.Implemented diagnostic techniques to identify and correct issues with the model like multicollinearity and presence of outliers.

## [GLM and Logistic Regression with R](https://github.com/sana1410/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/GLM%20and%20Logistic%20Regression)
The objective of this project is use "college dataset" from ISLR library to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a university is private or public.
1.Performed Exploratory Data analysis and Descriptive analysis on dataset.
2.Data preparation for modelling that included spitting the dataset into train and test data.
3.Fit logistic regression model using glm() function in R.
4.Created confusion matrix for both train and test datasets.
5.Calculated and interpreted model metrics like Accuracy,Recall , Specificity and Precision for both Train and test datasets.
6.Plot and interpret ROC curve and AUC for both test and train datasets .
