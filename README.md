## [Regression Diagnostic with R](https://sana1410.github.io/R-Projects/)
* In this project we are going to fit, interpret and evaluate linear regression model on “AmesHousing” dataset.
* Performed Exploratory Data analysis and descriptive statistics to describe data.
* Performed Data cleaning by imputing missing values with zero.
* Created correlation matrix and plots to find highly correlated variables.
* Performed Linear regression and model interpretation using diagnostic plots.
* Implemented diagnostic techniques to identify and correct issues with the model like multicollinearity and presence of outliers.

## [GLM and Logistic Regression with R](https://sana1410.github.io/R-Projects/)
The objective of this project is use "college dataset" from ISLR library to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a university is private or public.
* Performed Exploratory Data analysis and Descriptive analysis on dataset.
* Data preparation for modelling that included spitting the dataset into train and test data.
* Fit logistic regression model using glm() function in R.
* Created confusion matrix for both train and test datasets.
* Calculated and interpreted model metrics like Accuracy,Recall , Specificity and Precision for both Train and test datasets.
* Plot and interpret ROC curve and AUC for both test and train datasets .

## Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Prediction
In this Project, we are going to perform linear regression to predict the air quality using data which we have taken from ![Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00501/PRSA2017_Data_20130301-20170228.zip).
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis using the dataset.
* Performed Data cleaning by removing the null values in dataset.
* Fitting linear regression model using sklearn.linear_model and interpreting the model.
* Evaluated and tested the model using RMSE values.
